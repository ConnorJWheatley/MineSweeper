####A class  should  be  created  to  allow new  scores  to  be  entered into  this  text  file. Methods  should  be  added  to  return  the  top 5 scores  of  all  time. These  scores should be displayed on-screen at the end of a round of your game.

1. Two event handler classes should be created to respond to keyboard events (e.g. pressing the arrow keys) and mouse events (e.g. pressing the mouse buttons). // in progress

2. A short  report should  be  produced  showing  the testing of  your  program (see below).
The  report  should  also briefly describe  how  the  how  the application makes use/ could make use of an appropriate design patterns: 
see links below(also to be covered in the lecture) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO_3L-mxVNw https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5448/f12/presentation-materials/rao.pdf

3. The remainder of the marks are allocated for developing a game using these basic building blocks:

- Your game should be 2D and use the appropriate game object / shape classes, event handlers, and a score tracker developed above. 
- The  game  can  be  based  on  classic  arcade  games  (Pong,  Space  invaders, Pacman etc.) or a board game (chess, snakes and ladders etc) or one of your own design.
- After the end of a round of your game a score should be allocated (this could be based on some outcome of the game, e.g. in pong you could gain 1 point for winning, or the length of time you survive for). 
- The total score  should  be  displayed  to  players  after  finishing  a  game  along with their all-time ranking. 
- An interface should be available to allow the top 5 all-time best scores to be displayed. // add a button that starts the timer, this way the game doesnt start until that button is pressed and make another button that can show a window of the top 5 scores
